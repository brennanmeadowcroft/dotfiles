## ZSH
ZSH plugins are managed with [Znap (zsh-snap)](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-snap).  Plugins are initialized by adding to .zshrc:

```
znap source <repo>
```

All new plugins are downloaded into the plugins folder when the terminal starts up.  This folder is currently ignored since it can be recreated on demand.

Additional plugins can be found: https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins
